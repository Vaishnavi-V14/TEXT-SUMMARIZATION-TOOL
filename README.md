Overview of the project

Project:  TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL


Objective

To develop a text summarization tool that efficiently extracts or generates concise and coherent summaries from lengthy documents or text inputs, enabling quick comprehension of key information while preserving the original meaning and context.


Key Activities

•	Data Collection: Gather diverse text datasets for training and evaluation.
•	Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text to prepare it for summarization.
•	Model Training: Train the model using labeled data or fine-tune pre-trained models 
•	Integration: Develop a user-friendly interface for text input and summary output.
•	Testing & Optimization: Test the tool with various text types and optimize for better accuracy and speed.



Technology Used
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP): Libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim for text preprocessing and tokenization.
• Transformers Library: Hugging Face's Transformers for leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained models for summarization.
•	Flask/Django: Frameworks for building APIs or web applications for the summarization tool.
•	Evaluation Metrics: ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR for evaluating summary quality.
